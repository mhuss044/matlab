2.Report the full transfer matrix for each system, as a product of all the individual 
matrices (see TMM theory below), for arbitrary incident wavelengt
3.Evaluate analytically each system at the central wavelength, present the formula for the reflectance at this wavelength, and 
determine the relationship between the index values that minimizes this reflectance
4.Provide the requested refractive index values. 

5. algo to numerically evaluate the power production
6. Provide plots of the nominally optimal reflectivity (i.e., the reflectivity for the quarter-wave stack whose indices were analytically determined).

wav vs R

7. Tabulate (or plot) the dependence of the power  4
production on layer indices and thicknesses to ascertain if the design approach followed does indeed maximize power production. Discuss and suggest other optimization approaches.

vary n for the above, to see max power
